# Daily Challenge - DNA Strand
Inspired by: https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-175-complementary-dna-6o1

## Description
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

In DNA strings, symbols `"A" and "T"` and `"C" and "G"` are complements of each other. Implement a function `dna_strand` to match the given side of DNA with its complementary side.
